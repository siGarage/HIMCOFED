    It is with immense pleasure that I, as the Administrator of Himachal Pradesh State Cooperative
Development Federation (HIMCOFED), extend a warm and hearty welcome to you on our official
website.<br/><br/>
Himcofed, establish in 1960 under the visionary guidance of the government, has been at the
forefront of cooperative education and training in Himachal Pradesh. Our mission is to empower
individuals and cooperative societies with the knowledge and skills necessary to foster a thriving
cooperative movement in our state.<br/><br/>
At Himcofed, we take great pride in our two state level cooperative training centers, where our
dedicated team conducts the annual four-months Cooperative Diploma Course. This course is a
cornerstone of our commitment to imparting valuable knowledge, fostering collaboration, and
promoting the spirit within our community.<br/><br/>
Additionally, we work tirelessly to provide training and support to the management and
members of cooperative societies at the block and village levels. We believe that strong and
well-informed cooperative societies are the bedrock of a prosperous and harmonious Himachal
Pradesh.<br/><br/>
Our website aims to be a comprehensive resource for information, updates and resources

serve as a valuable platform for communication, knowledge-sharing, and engagement for all our
stakeholders.<br/><br/>
